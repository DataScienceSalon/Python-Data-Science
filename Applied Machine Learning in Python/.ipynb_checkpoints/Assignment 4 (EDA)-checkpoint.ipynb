    "## Assignment 4 - Understanding and Predicting Property Maintenance Fines\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment is based on a data challenge from the Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](http://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Michigan Data Science Team ([MDST](http://midas.umich.edu/mdst/)) and the Michigan Student Symposium for Interdisciplinary Statistical Sciences ([MSSISS](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/mssiss/)) have partnered with the City of Detroit to help solve one of the most pressing problems facing Detroit - blight. [Blight violations](http://www.detroitmi.gov/How-Do-I/Report/Blight-Complaint-FAQs) are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in answering this question is understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket. This is where predictive modeling comes in. For this assignment, your task is to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data for this assignment has been provided to us through the [Detroit Open Data Portal](https://data.detroitmi.gov/). **Only the data already included in your Coursera directory can be used for training the model for this assignment.** Nonetheless, we encourage you to look into data from other Detroit datasets to help inform feature creation and model selection. We recommend taking a look at the following related datasets:\n",

    "We provide you with two data files for use in training and validating your models: train.csv and test.csv. Each row in these two files corresponds to a single blight ticket, and includes information about when, why, and to whom each ticket was issued. The target variable is compliance, which is True if the ticket was paid early, on time, or within one month of the hearing data, False if the ticket was paid after the hearing date or not at all, and Null if the violator was found not responsible. Compliance, as well as a handful of other variables that will not be available at test-time, are only included in train.csv.\n",

    "# Data Preprocessing\n",
    "## Data Quality Assessment\n",
    "A data quality assessment was conducted to determine the degree of data cleaning, transformation, and data reduction that would be required. A cursory and unstructured analysis revealed:\n",
    "1. A non-trivial degree of spelling errors were found in the address fields. Any analysis based upon city would require significant preprocessing to correct misspellings, abbreviations which were found in approximately 10% of the observations. \n",
    "2. Hearing date was missing for both compliant and non-compliant observations and in some cases preceded the ticket_issue\n",
    "date. \n",
    "4. Compliance values were missing for judgments in which the alleged violator was found to be not responsible. This would require some data reduction to illiminate those observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning\n",
    "The intent at this stage was to address some of the data quality issues, rule-out variables not useful to the analysis, and to remove missing data that could not be impuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Reduction\n",
    "The following observations were removed from the data set.\n",
    "1. The observations in which the alleged violator was judged to be 'not responsible by disposition' were removed from the data set. This reduced the data set from 250,306 to 159,880 observations. \n",
    "2. Observations with missing hearing dates also removed further reducing the available training data to an approximate 159,700 observations.\n",
    "3. Lastly, observations in which the hearing dates were before the ticket issue date were excised from the data, leaving a total training set size of 159,572 observations.\n",

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "The following variables were removed from the data set for reasons of redundancy, lack of association with the target variable, or other practical concerns.\n",
    "- ticket_id - used for indexing purposes only\n",
    "- violator_name - Too many levels and could lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- violation_street_number - No association with compliance\n",
    "- violation_zip_code - all blanks\n",
    "- mailing_address_str_number - No association with compliance\n",
    "- mailing_address_str_name - Frought with misspellings.  Zip code was a better proxy for location\n",
    "- non_us_str_code and country were removed given the extreme imbalance in the data set.\n",
    "- violation_description - directly correlated with violation_code, which was a higher quality indicator\n",
    "- fine_amount - included in judgement amount (unless alleged violator deemed not responsible)\n",
    "- admin_fee - included in judgement amount\n",
    "- state_fee - included in judgement amount\n",
    "- late_fee - included in judgement amount\n",
    "- discount_amount - included in judgment amount\n",
    "- clean_up_cost - correlated with judgment amount\n",
    "- grafitti_status - correlated with judgment amount\n",
